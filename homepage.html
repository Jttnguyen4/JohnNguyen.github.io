						<h1>Background</h1>
						<p>I am a junior majoring in XA. I've always loved to design and create things growing up, but I didnâ€™t specifically know what I could do with this skill. I was a CS major before switching to XA because I thought coding was the way to go since our world is run by technology. After finding out coding just wasn't it for me, I was introduced to XA and it really got me passionate about creating and designing again. I hope that I can be able to take the skills and knowledge that I am taught to create things that will help our future be a better place.</p>

					<div class = "box box3">
						<h1>Goals</h1>
						<p> My goal is to one day design a vehicle that will allow people of all sizes drive confortablly!</p>
					</div>

					<div class = "box box4">
						<h1>Passions</h1>
						<p>Outside of my friend of XA, I am very passionate about my faith as well as my friends and family. I am part of a community called TNTT which is a Vietnamese Eucharistic Youth Movement where we do fun activities and do food drives to help other support communities that are in need or to helping grow our community even more. I enjoy playing or watching sports with my family, especially basketball. </p>
